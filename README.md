# 🗂️ Distributed Logging System

## 📌 Overview
In a microservices architecture, effective log management is crucial for operational excellence. This project streamlines the collection, storage, and analysis of logs generated by various services, enhancing the ability to track application behavior and identify errors quickly. By capturing relevant metadata alongside each log entry and enabling real-time ingestion and querying, the system improves operational visibility and facilitates proactive responses to potential issues.  

## 🏗️ System Architecture
- **Microservices (Nodes)**: Distributed services that generate logs and send heartbeat signals to monitor status.
- **Log Accumulator**: Collects, structures, and forwards logs to the Pub-Sub model.
- **Pub-Sub Model**: Facilitates reliable, asynchronous log distribution.
- **Log Storage**: Indexes and stores logs in a searchable format.
- **Alerting System**: Detects and alerts on `ERROR` and `WARN` logs in real-time.
- **Heartbeat Mechanism**: Detects node failures by monitoring missing heartbeat signals.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- **Languages**: Python
- **Log Accumulator**: Fluentd
- **Pub-Sub Model**: Apache Kafka
- **Log Storage**: Elasticsearch

## 📝 Log Levels
- **INFO**: General system operations.
- **WARN**: Potential issues.
- **ERROR**: Errors that allow system to continue running.
